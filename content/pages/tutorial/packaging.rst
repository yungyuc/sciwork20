Tutorial - Packaging: Share your code for pip and Conda
=======================================================

Python packages are reusable code that can be fetched, installed, and then
imported by another program. Their contents are exactly the same as any Python
project, only contains some extra configuration, so they can be bundled and
uploaded to a shared place, for users to download from. This tutorial will
teach you how to generate said metadata, so you can bundle your code into a
"distributable," for others to install with either pip or Conda.

Goal
====

Attendees will be able to produce a Python package using Setuptools's PEP 517
backend, ready to be published to both a Python Package Index (PyPI) and a
community Conda repository (conda-forge). The package will contain both
importable Python files (pure modules and packages) and non-code data files.
Attendees will also be able to familiarize themselves with commonly-used
project management tools, and be ready to understand workflows of popular
packages, and to make contributions for them.
