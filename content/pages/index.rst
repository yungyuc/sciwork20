Science, code, and open source
==============================

Update (2/3): Because of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), our venue NCTU will
delay the classes to 3/2, and we will follow.  We are working on the new date
(the original date was 22nd February, 2020), and will udpate when it is set.
If the new time doesn't work for you, we will arrange refund.  Sorry for the
potential inconvenience.

Update (1/8): Sciwork is open for registration:

Sciwork is a conference for researchers and engineers to share and discuss
computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.  It will be held
in Hsinchu (we are rescheduling due to the novel coronavirus).  We believe in
the power of openness, and we will use open source as a means to advance
software development for computational sciences.

Computational sciences are critically important as information technology has
blended in every aspect of human activities.  Proficiently speaking programming
languages is a prerequisite for conducting most research and engineering work,
and as practitioners observe, the simple task evolves into a hierarchy of
skills that take years to acquire.  To properly use computers for science or
engineering, the problem is two-fold.  We need a thorough understanding of the
problem to solve, and simultaneously we need to master computer programming to
deliver reliable solution.  It is overly challenging since either of both is
already complicated.

Sciwork would like to get involved in the global effort to solve the issue of
code development entangling with science and engineering.  There will be
sprints, hands-on tutorials, and technical talks in the conference.  Attendees
are expected to be in different levels of code development.  We will work
together for good and open computational sciences.
