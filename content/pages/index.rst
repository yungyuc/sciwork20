Science, code, and open source
==============================

Update (2/14): The conference will be rescheduled to 21st March because of `the
delay of classes <https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3869939>`__.

Sciwork is a conference for researchers and engineers to share and discuss
computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.  It will be held
in Hsinchu on 21st March 2020.  We believe in the power of openness, and we
will use open source as a means to advance software development for
computational sciences.

Computational sciences are critically important as information technology has
blended in every aspect of human activities.  Proficiently speaking programming
languages is a prerequisite for conducting most research and engineering work,
and as practitioners observe, the simple task evolves into a hierarchy of
skills that take years to acquire.  To properly use computers for science or
engineering, the problem is two-fold.  We need a thorough understanding of the
problem to solve, and simultaneously we need to master computer programming to
deliver reliable solution.  It is overly challenging since either of both is
already complicated.

Sciwork would like to get involved in the global effort to solve the issue of
code development entangling with science and engineering.  There will be
sprints, hands-on tutorials, and technical talks in the conference.  Attendees
are expected to be in different levels of code development.  We will work
together for good and open computational sciences.

Areas of topics
===============

* Array processing
* Mathematical and numerical libraries
* Geometry and visualization
* Physics, chemistry, and their applications
* Other science and engineering
* C++, Python, and other programming languages
* Compiler, development environment, and software engineering
* High-performance computing, parallel computing, distributed computing, and
  concurrent computing
* Cloud, networking, and storage

Previous updates
================

Update (2/3): Because of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), our venue NCTU will
`delay the classes to 3/2 <https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3869939>`__,
and we will follow.  We are working on the new date (the original date was 22nd
February, 2020), and will udpate when it is set.  If the new time doesn't work
for you, we will arrange refund.  Sorry for the potential inconvenience.

Update (1/8): Sciwork is open for registration:
