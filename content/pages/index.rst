Science, code, and open source
==============================

Sciwork is a conference for researchers and engineers to share and discuss
computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work.  It will be held
in Hsinchu on 22nd February 2020.  We believe in the power of openness, and we
will use open source as a means to advance software development for
computational sciences.

Computational sciences are critically important as information technology has
blended in every aspect of human activities.  Proficiently speaking programming
languages is a prerequisite for conducting most research and engineering work,
and as practitioners observe, the simple task evolves into a hierarchy of
skills that take years to acquire.  To properly use computers for science or
engineering, the problem is two-fold.  We need a thorough understanding of the
problem to solve, and simultaneously we need to master computer programming to
deliver reliable solution.  It is overly challenging since either of both is
already complicated.

Sciwork would like to get involved in the global effort to solve the issue of
code development entangling with science and engineering.  There will be
sprints, hands-on tutorials, and technical talks in the conference.  Attendees
are expected to be in different levels of code development.  We will work
together for good and open computational sciences.

See the `program page <program.html>`__ for talk proposal submission.
